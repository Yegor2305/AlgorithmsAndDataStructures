This project is demonstration of some data structures and algorithms, from hash table and trees to Huffman tree and graph algorithms.  
There is a problem with B-Tree, to be precise in its logic, because during programming this part I haven't fully figured out how much keys and children should contain tree node, depending on tree degree.  
Despite this, it has (to my mind) good visualization of adding and deleting nodes.  
P.S. Everything presented in this program were developed by my own during learning algorithms and data strucures, so I don't guarantee (likely) it is best realization
